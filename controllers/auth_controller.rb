  # to obtain oauth credentials.

  # new account. If a request comes from a user that is logged in it is assumed
  # to originate from the edit profile page and the request is to add a linked
  # account. If the request does not come from a user it is assumed to be a new
  # user and the auth information is collected to provision a new account. The
  # username is checked to ensure it is unique, if it is not, or if there is a
  # screwy facebook nickname the user is redirected to /users/new to change
  # their registration information. If the username is unique and not facebook
  # screwery the user is sent to the confirmation page where they will confirm
  # their username and enter an email address.
  # If an authorization is present then it is assumed to be a successful
  # authentication. The oauth credentials for the user in question are checked
  # and stored if not present (this is to provide oauth credentials for legacy
  # users). A new user session is generated and the user is redirected to /
